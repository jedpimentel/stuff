        <h1>Random Demos</h1>

        <p>Some demos might not work well (or at all) on your current device. This ain't a complete list.</p>  

        <!-- <h3><a href="ar.html">ar</a></h3>
        <p>Fullscreen AR</p>

        <h3><a href="ar-embedded.html">ar-embedded</a></h3>
        <p>AR, embedded into a regular HTML layout.</p> -->

        <h3><a href="physics.html">Grip to move + Physics</a></h3>
        <p>Custom movement controls, plus the aframe-physics-system library.</p>

        <h3><a href="audio.html">Positional Audio</a></h3>
        <p>A-Frame supports positional audio out of the box</p>

        <h3><a href="bench.html">Pointy Line Ball Thing</a></h3>
        <p>A bunch of spheres, laid out in a sphere, with lines pointing out from them.</p>

        <h3><a href="thing.html">NumBall</a></h3>
        <p>White circle with "000" in it in black text. It's closer to the camera than the background. On 2D-displays the ball looks bigger than it is because of perspective, on 3D-displays you can tell it's just being rendered closer o your face.</p>

        <h3><a href="touch-controls.html">touch-controls</a></h3>
        <p>Move around a 3D scene using an touchscreen joystick. Part of my effort to make VR scenes accessible on 2D-touchscreens as a 3D environment.</p>

        <h3><a href="webcam.html">webcam</a></h3>
        <p>Webcam passthrough stuff. Originally meant to try out what passthrough would look like on a cardboard-class headset. Doesn't work on Oculus Quest, prob since the cameras are for tracking, not video.</p>

        <h3><a href="shaggy-rogers/index.html">Shaggy from Scooby Doo, with a bigger Shaggy in the background</a></h3>
        <p>I made this, no use not making it available. #SorryNotSorry</p>

        <h3><a href="player/index.html">Video Player</a></h3>
        <p>An attempt at a WebVR video player. Only has play/pause for now.</p>
