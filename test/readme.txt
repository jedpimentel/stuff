stuff/test

index.html should be updated with descriptions for each file in this folder.

cage.html is for prototyping new stuff

cube-clicker.html is meant to be an action game. 

	Cubes appear and user has to "click" them for points. Maybe include different types of cubes, including some that are worth negative points if you click/intersect them. Game could be split off into a shooter where you shoot the cubes, then maybe replace cubes with models.

	Could also make game take place in the ocean, and replace cubes with plastic bagss ("bag bagger" ?)
