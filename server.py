# temp server for local testing

# you'll need a local server in order to host images

# windows: just do:
# 	py -m http.server 8000

# TODO:
# - actually write this component
# - Real backend will be needed to stream the server's webcam

# Nice to haves:
# something to calculate the repo size, might need a database soon if I keep using scanned drawing
