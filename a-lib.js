	FIRST ATTEMPT AT WRITING A LIBRARY

	I'm currently working on a web-controlled physical/hardware robot that I want to recycle code with.
	So far (20190302) I have an elbow-length 6DOF arm with no software, and a box of parts which which to make a wheeled base for it.

	UI for controlling the robot will have two phases:

		1) User got into a regular/flat html layout with details on what to expect,
		and a wizard to find out what devices are available user-side

		2) User is dropped into an aframe scene from which they can control the robot
		in a manner similar to a mecha. The scene will have a (rough?) representation
		of the robot, which allows you to click a servo to rotate it individually, or
		try to map something like the effector to a handheld controller, trying to
		get close to a useful 1:1 movement mapping (a 6DOF arm might not be enough)


	For now, I'm working on the arm first, since I already did a proof-of-concept for the base/camera stuff. Wheelbase stuff TBA.
